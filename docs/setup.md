Installfest: Getting Set Up
===========================

## Requirements

Everyone in the workshop should have a laptop. If it is running Windows, it should be running Windows 7 or above. If it is running OS X, it should be running 10.7 "Lion" or above. If it is running Linux, you are probably fine.

If anyone attending does not have access to a laptop running one of the above choices, let the instructors know. You can either pair with someone else, or we can provide a virtual machine that you can run if you have a laptop.

## What we are installing

### All students:

By the end of these instructions, you will have the following installed:

* Java, a "virtual machine" that Clojure runs atop of
* Leiningen, a tool for running Clojure programs
* Nightcode, an editor for Clojure and other programming languages
 
### Track 2 students will additionally install:

* Git, a program for managing your program's code 

And you will have:

<!--
* Created a ````ssh```` key (the public part of which will be uploaded to github and heroku)
* Copied the example chat application with ````git clone````
* Pushed your copy of the chat application to heroku
* Joined the ````#clojure.mn```` IRC channel
-->
